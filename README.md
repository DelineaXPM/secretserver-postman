# Secert Server Postman Collections

This repository contains an environment and collection export for Postman based on the API documents for Secret Server's REST API.

The collection allows you to test the Secret Server APIs from within Postman. This collection will work against both Secret Server (on-premises) and Secret Server Cloud.

## Visualize

Each collection includes a JavaScript that will **attempt to** parse the `records` object (if the endpoint returns one) and build a formatted table to view the data:

## Troubleshooting Postman

If you are using this collection against your internal or local Secret Server lab you may see an initial error like this when you try to retrieve an access token:

If you show the Postman console (`ATL + CTRL + C` or _View | Show Postman Console_) you will see this message to indicate the SSL certificate for your web service cannot be validated:

To fix this you need to go into your settings for Postman (`CTRL + comma` or _File | Settings_) and toggle off the setting **SSL certificate verification**.
